# ft_printf
Recoding printf in a kind of dirty way, because of certain rules that i had to apply (25 lines per function, no multiple ternary and such - they are general good rules, but that's the catch *general* - anyway, probably shouldn't have finished it carelessly.
This took me about 3/4 days of work - I'm sure there are still some bugs for me to find ;P
